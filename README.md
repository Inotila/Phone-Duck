# Phone-Duck

This project is for my final submission for my Java Backend individual assignment. The aim of the project is to create a messaging app.

## About Phone-Duck
A messaging app. To test it use postman using these following end points. Remember to update date the body and the userID params where need.
1. http://localhost:8080/channels/ retrieve a list of advertised channels
2. http://localhost:8080/channels/ create a new channel
3. http://localhost:8080/channels/{id} delete a channel
4. http://localhost:8080/channels/{id} update the title of a channel
5. http://localhost:8080/channels/{id}/messages creates a new message in a channel
6. http://localhost:8080/channels/{id}/messages  retrieves all messages

## Value
Bored user can use the app to hop on to a channel and send messages
